To begin my implementation, I started by converting the given text file, "trainingSamples.txt", into a csv file. This allowed me to utilize the tools available in the pandas library to easily read the training data in my genetic algorithm. Next, I created a series of methods which allowed me to properly utilize the registers, operands, and constants according to the specifications provided. This was the most challenging part of the assignment for me as I had very limited knowledge of assembly language when I started. After I implemented this, I was able to create the functions for fitness, parent selection, recombination, and mutation. Of course, I did testing on each method to ensure it was working properly prior to moving on to implementation of the following functions. I included the replacement (i.e., child selection) directly in my main method. I was having some trouble with tuning my parameters in order to get the best result, and while I believe the current result is sufficient, I think it could be better if I spent more time in terms of experimenting with different combinations of parameter values. Overall, I learned a lot from this assignment.
